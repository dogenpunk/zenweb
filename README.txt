DESCRIPTION:
  
ZenWeb is a set of classes/tools for organizing and formating a
website. It is website oriented rather than webpage oriented, unlike
most rendering tools. It is content oriented, rather than style
oriented, unlike most rendering tools. It provides a plugin system of
renderers and filters to provide a very flexible, and powerful system.

(Minimal) documentation is available in the demo directory. See
QuickStart and YourOwnWebsite for setup and starting to build a
website.
  
FEATURES:
  
+ SiteMap oriented for a comprehensive website.
+ Generic architecture w/ a set of plugins to extend any page or directory.
+ Incremental page builds for very fast generation.
+ Simple text-to-html markup makes creating large websites easy.
+ Much much more... I should probably add that here, huh?

REQUIREMENTS:

+ Ruby - not sure about minimal version, but 1.6.x has been tested.
+ Test::Unit testing framework via RAA on http://www.ruby-lang.org/.

INSTALL:

+ make test && sudo make install
