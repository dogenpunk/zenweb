* ZenWeb 2.0 Planning:

** Requirements:

*** Major

These items are needed for betatesting.

**** Sitemap

Reads simple sitemap description file, from there generates website. 

Urls in sitemap must map to filesystem.

Must deal with ~username urls correctly.

Sitemap must give each document the knowedge of it's relatives (parent, children, siblings)

**** Flexible metadata system

Metadata must be available per directory, each child overlaying the parents.

Metadata must be available per file, overlaying the directory.

Metadata must be flexible, allowing for basically anything to be a value.

Metadata will drive most of the process. 

**** Rendering Engine(s)

System must allow for multiple rendering engines to be applied to any given datafile.

Engines are specified by metadata.

Example engines must be supplied: 
  Raw
  text2html
  embedded ruby
  header/footer.

*** Minor

These items are not needed for betatesting, but should be implemented
for final shipment.

**** Differential Rendering

Whatever generates the HTML should know about the structure and
generate the minimum set necessary. This includes building parents,
children, and immediate siblings ONLY when we actually need them
built.

Important relationships should be specified by metadata.

**** Tools

System could use sitemap and metadata to simply generate a makefile
and execute it.

Tool to find files not in sitemap.

Tool to find files in sitemap, but not on filesystem. Generate
template for quick prototyping of website.

**** Extras

Possibly design for live execution in server.
