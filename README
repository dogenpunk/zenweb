Quickstart:

1) make sure that you have python correctly installed. Understanding of python is critical to ZenWeb (extending it at least).

2) Run 'demo.py', if 'demohtml' is not created in the same directory, something is wrong. Investigate, and email support@ZenSpider.com for any help needed.

3) Use a copy of 'demo' as a starting point for your website.

4) Documentation is available at http://www.ZenSpider.com/

If you have any suggestions, comments, compliants, or need help, please email support@ZenSpider.com, thank you.
