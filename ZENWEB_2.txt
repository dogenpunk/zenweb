* ZenWeb 2.0 Planning:

** Requirements:

*** Major

These items are needed for betatesting.

**** Sitemap

Reads simple sitemap description file, from there generates
website. 

All metadata will be in sitemap.

Urls in sitemap must map to filesystem.

Must deal with ~username urls correctly.

**** HTML Generation &/or embedded ruby

Simple plaintext to HTML conversion. Standard to ZenWeb or Wiki.

Embedded HTML should be allowed. Should be smart enough to not 
generate invalid HTML.

Some type of macro stuff, but not a full eRuby.

OR, all plaintext to HTML could be an extension to eRuby.

*** Minor

These items are not needed for betatesting, but should be implemented
for final shipment.

**** Tools

System could use sitemap and metadata to simply generate a makefile
and execute it.

Whatever generates the HTML should know about the structure and
generate the minimum set necessary. This includes building parents,
children, and immediate siblings ONLY when we actually need them
built. Something in the metadata should say something about this.

Tool to find files not in sitemap.

Tool to find files in sitemap, but not on filesystem. Generate
template for quick prototyping of website.

**** Extras

Possibly design for live execution in server.
