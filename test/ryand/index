	+ With a sub-list

Paragraphs can contain http://www.ZenSpider.com/ZSS/ZenWeb/ and mailto:zss@ZenSpider.com and they will automatically be converted. Don't forget less-than "\<" \& greater-than "\>", but only if backslashed.

Supports <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com">Unaltered urls</A> as well.

Likewise, two lines side by side
are considered one paragraph. Supports <I>Embedded HTML</I>.

  PRE blocks are paragraphs that are indented two spaces on each line.
  The two spaces will be stripped, and all other indentation will be left
  alone.
     this allows me to put things like code examples in and retain
         their formatting.
