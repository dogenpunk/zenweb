#title ZenWeb Demo
#description Demo of ZenWeb
#keywords ZenWeb, Stuff

Not much for now. I will add more instructions later. I am SURE that
as is, you won't like the site exactly, but you can get started on the
content and structure. I haven't done the best job of extracting MY
website stuff from ZenWebsite/ZenDocument but I will work on it.

Instructions for getting started with ruby and ZenWeb exist on the
#{QuickStart} page.

Instructions exist for creating a new or converting an existing
website on the #{Your Own Website} page.
