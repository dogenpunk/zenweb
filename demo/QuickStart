You are _expected_ to understand Python minimally to build a site
(installation and basic use). It isn't hard to install on either UNIX
or the macintosh, I've never used it on windoze.

You are expected to understand Python programming only if you want to
customize site/page layout. This includes, navigation, headers and
footers, and general page layout.

Install and run python (no args), make sure that "1+1" outputs
"2". That states that, yes, you installed it:

<PRE>
    [501] python
    Python 1.5.1 (#1, Jun 12 1998, 17:16:56) [C] on osf1V4
    Copyright 1991-1995 Stichting Mathematisch Centrum, Amsterdam
    >>> 1 + 1
    2
    >>> ^D
    [502]
</PRE>

Make sure that your PYTHONLIB environment variable (or equivalent on
other platforms) is set to include both ZenWeb AND ZenWeb/HTMLgen.

<PRE>
    [503] export PYTHONPATH=$PWD/ZenWeb:$PWD/ZenWeb/HTMLGen
</PRE>

Run demo.py. If the above was done correctly, it should run without a
hitch. If not, then doublecheck your PYTHONLIB variable and make sure
there are no name collisions. If everything looks fine, but still
doesn't work, please email {support}, thanks.

<PRE>
    [504] python ./demo.py 
    ./demohtml/index.html
    ./demohtml/SiteMap.html
    ./demohtml/QuickStart.html
    ./demohtml/Features.html
</PRE>

A new directory demohtml should now exist. Check it out in your
browser. It contains some docs to get your site up and running.

Any questions, flames, requests, whatever should be sent to
{support}. Thank you.
