You are _expected_ to understand Ruby minimally to build a site
(installation and basic use). It isn't hard to install on either UNIX
or the macintosh, I've never used it on windoze but I've been told it
is fairly easy there as well.

You are expected to understand Ruby programming only if you want to
customize site/page layout. This includes, navigation, headers and
footers, and general page layout. The basic setup will look like
http://www.zenspider.com/ otherwise.

Install and run irb with no args, make sure that "1+1" outputs
"2". That states that, yes, you installed ruby correctly:

<PRE>
    % irb
    irb(main):001:0> 1+1
    2
    irb(main):002:0> ^D
    %
</PRE>

You need to have Test::Unit installed. You should be able to get it
from #{raa}.

Run 'make test'. If all is well, you should have zero errors listed
after running all of the tests. A new directory demohtml should now
exist. Check it out in your browser. It contains some docs to get your
site up and running.

Any questions, flames, requests, whatever should be sent to
#{support}. Thank you.
