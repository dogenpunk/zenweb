ZenWeb is supposed to be rather easy to use. This demo site is intended to be a demonstration that it is easy. If this takes me more than 10 minutes to do (including typing these pages), then I have failed my job.

** How I made this demo site:

+ I created a directory called demo.
+ I created a file in demo called SiteMap.
	+ In that file I gave it a title, description and keywords.
	+ I then created a list of URLs (minus the base part of the URL) for the pages in the site.
+ I then created a file for each URL in the sitemap and put them in demo. NOTE: The file names do not have ".html" in them because they aren't HTML files.
+ I then ran '<CODE>ZenWeb.rb demo</CODE>' in order to render it to HTML.

** How you make YOUR new site:

+ Copy demo's SiteMap and metadata.txt to a new directory (e.g. "mysite").
+ Modify the SiteMap to contain the pages of your site.
+ Use '<CODE>ZenWebpage.rb filename title subtitle</CODE>' to create new template pages. The subtitle is optional.
+ Run demo.py

** How to convert your OLD site:

+ Do the same as the new site instructions, except:
	+ For each file, remove your HTML header and footer code.
