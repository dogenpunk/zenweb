ZenWeb is supposed to be rather easy to use. This demo site is
intended to be a demonstration that it is easy. If this takes me more
than 10 minutes to do (including typing these pages), then I have
failed my job.

** How to make a site from scratch:

+ Run the following commands:
	+ <CODE>mkdir mysite</CODE>
	+ <CODE>ZenWebpage.rb mysite/index</CODE>
	+ <CODE>ZenWebpage.rb mysite/SiteMap</CODE>
	+ <CODE>ZenWebpage.rb mysite/metadata.txt</CODE>
	+ <CODE>ZenWeb.rb mysite</CODE>
+ Edit as you see fit.
+ See the #{TextToHTML} page for markup hints and tips.

** How to add a page to your site:

+ Modify mysite/SiteMap and add the url to the page, including .html, excluding the domain of the url (ex: "/blah.html").
+ Run the following commands:
	+ <CODE>ZenWebpage.rb mysite/blah.html</CODE>
	+ <CODE>touch mysite/SiteMap</CODE>
	+ <CODE>ZenWeb.rb mysite</CODE>

** How to convert an old site:

+ Do the same as the new site instructions, except:
	+ For each file, remove your HTML header and footer code.
