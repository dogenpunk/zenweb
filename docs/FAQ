%- Q: I don't want to use ZenWeb for a whole domain, just a small portion of the website, but it keeps making absolute URLs that don't work well for this design. How can I use ZenWeb?
%= A: Add RelativeRenderer to your list of renderers in your top level metadata.txt file. If you used ZenWebsite.rb to create your website, the entry should be there, otherwise add "'renderers' = [ 'StandardRenderer', 'RelativeRenderer' ]".

%- Q: XXX
%= A: YYY
