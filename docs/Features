** Metadata Variables:

Metadata variables can be defined in the page itself, or in any
metadata.txt file in the directory tree. Scoping is from top down, so
the lowest definition wins.

Here is a list of the variables in use by HtmlTemplateRenderer:

%- author
%= added as a META tag if it exists, I suggest NOT putting your email in here.
%- banner
%= graphic at the top of the page, usually a logo
%- bgcolor
%= defaults to not being defined
%- copyright
%= added as a META tag if it exists.
%- description
%= added as a META tag if it exists
%- dtd
%= Doctype declaration of the document. (default: 'DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional')
%- email
%= used in a mailto in metadata
%- keywords
%= added as a META tag for search engines.
%- rating
%= added as a meta tag for filter services (default: 'general')
%- stylesheet
%= CSS stylesheet URL.
%- style
%= CSS code applied directly to the page. style and stylesheet are not mutually exclusive.
%- subtitle
%= Subtitle of document.
%- title
%= Title of document. (default: 'Unknown Title')
%- charset
%= Character encoding for the page.
%- force
%= Set to true (no quotes necessary) to force page to render every time.

Additionally, HeaderRenderer and FooterRenderer use entries called
'header' and 'footer' respectively.
