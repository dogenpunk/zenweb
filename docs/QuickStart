** Requirements:

+ ruby 1.6.x, may work w/ previous versions.
+ Test::Unit ruby package installed. Get from #{raa}.
+ Minimal understanding of Ruby:
	+ You are _expected_ to understand Ruby minimally to build a site (installation and basic use). It isn't hard to install on either UNIX or the macintosh, I've never used it on windoze but I've been told it is fairly easy there as well.
	+ You are expected to understand Ruby programming only if you want to customize site/page layout. This includes, navigation, headers and footers, and general page layout. The basic setup will look like http://www.zenspider.com/ otherwise.

** Instructions:

+ Unpack the package. You've probably already done this.
+ Test your ruby installation. Run 'irb':
	+ At the prompt type "1+1" and make sure it outputs "2".
	+ That states that, yes, you installed ruby correctly.
+ Run 'make test'. 
	+ If all is well, you should have zero errors listed after running all of the tests. 
	+ If not, email #{support}. I respond quickly to problems.
+ Run 'make docs'.
	+ A new directory docshtml should now exist.
+ View docshtml in your browser.
	+ If you have apache you can quickly serve these pages (on unix):
		+ Run 'make apache'
		+ a private httpd will fire up running on port 8080.
	+ Otherwise, open the file directly in your browser
	+ Read all the pages, but start with #{Your Own Website}.

Any questions, flames, requests, whatever should be sent to
#{support}. Thank you.
